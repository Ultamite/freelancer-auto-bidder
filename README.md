# Freelance Bid Writer

A small automation utility that scrapes a freelance project description from a URL (Freelancer.com), generates a concise bid using an Ollama model, and pastes the generated proposal into the site's bid textarea via Selenium.

This repository is intended as a personal helper and demo of combining web automation (Selenium) with a local model API (Ollama), plus a few convenience features:

- GPU detection (PyTorch-based) — optional and non-blocking.
- Timing of model generation so you can measure latency.
- A template-driven prompt to produce consistent bids.

WARNING: Use responsibly. Automating bid submission may violate site terms of service. This project is intended for learning and experimentation only.

## Files

- `main.py` — Primary script. Fetches the project page, logs in using environment-stored credentials, generates the bid via Ollama and fills the bid textarea.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Chrome (matching your `chromedriver` version) and `chromedriver` available in `C:/SeleniumDrivers` (or add its path to your PATH environment variable).
- `pip` packages:
	- selenium
	- ollama (your local Ollama client)
	- python-dotenv (used in `main.py` to load credentials)
	- torch (optional — only for GPU detection; install with CUDA-enabled wheel if you want GPU support)

Install required packages (example):
```powershell
pip install selenium ollama python-dotenv
# Optional: install PyTorch with CUDA support if you want GPU detection/use
# See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the correct command for your platform
```

If you plan to run models locally through Ollama, make sure Ollama is running and the model referenced in `main.py` is downloaded and available (e.g., `llama3.1:8b`).

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project folder with your Freelancer credentials (used only for logging in):

```text
freelancer_username=you@example.com
freelancer_password=your_password_here
```

2. Ensure `chromedriver.exe` is in `C:/SeleniumDrivers` or update the code to point to your chromedriver location.

3. Ensure Ollama is running and the desired model is available. `main.py` uses `model = "llama3.1:8b"` by default; edit to match your local model name if different.

## Usage

Run the script and enter the project URL when prompted:

```powershell
python main.py
```

The script will:

1. Open Chrome via Selenium.
2. Ask for the project URL you want to bid on.
3. Log into Freelancer using credentials in `.env`.
4. Scrape the project description and construct a prompt from the built-in template.
5. Call Ollama to generate a bid and print it.
6. Print timing information like: `[timing] generation took 2.14s`.
7. Paste the generated bid into the bid textarea on the page.

## Timing and Performance

`main.py` measures how long `ollama.generate()` takes and prints the elapsed time. Use this to gauge latency for different models or prompts.

Tips to improve speed:

- Use a smaller model or a local (GPU-accelerated) model if available.
- If using PyTorch directly for other workloads, install a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build.
- Trim or simplify prompts to reduce token count sent to the model.

## GPU Notes

- The project includes a small PyTorch-based GPU detection block. This only detects whether a CUDA-capable GPU is available; it does not change how Ollama runs.
- To use GPU acceleration for model inference, ensure the model server (Ollama or other) is running with GPU support and that you installed appropriate GPU-enabled packages.

## Safety & Terms of Service

Automating interactions with third-party websites (login, form submission) can violate terms of service. Use this code only for personal learning and test accounts. Do not use it to spam or otherwise abuse platforms.

## Future improvements

- Add streaming/partial output to show generated text as it arrives.
- Add prompt trimming and caching to reduce repeated inference costs.
- Add a `--dry-run` flag to generate and print bids without pasting or interacting with websites.
